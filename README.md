#Analyzing data and predicting cancer type.
Prostate Cancer	
Introduction 
More than 1 million new diagnoses reported every year. Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer among males in the world which results in more than 350,000 deaths annually. I have used the machine learning algorithm for the dataset from Kaggle of 100 patients to interpret the results of what kind of cancer a person has.

Note: 

Usually cancers are 2 types which are malignant and benign cancers. The difference between these two are malignant cancer is the one grows and spreads to other parts of the body. A benign cancer is benign tumor which can grow but not spread to other parts of the body.
